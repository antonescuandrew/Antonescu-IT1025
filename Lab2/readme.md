#### Latency Vs. Transfer Rates
Latency has two distinct categories: seek time and rotational latency. Seek time is the time it takes to find the data physically on the disk. Rotational latency is the average time for a section of a disk to complete the seeking procedure. While latency is the delay while accessing data, transfer rates act as a cap on how much data can be transferred at once. 
#### Solid State Vs. Hard Drives
While hard drives use a physical disk to store data, solid state drives use Electronically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EEPROM) to store data. Solid state is much faster than hard drives, but cost more. 
#### Random Access Memory
Increasing RAM makes the computer faster because RAM transfers data much faster than a hard disk, while also allowing the computer to multitask and store more data at the same time. Additionally, there are many differences between 32-bit and 64-bit systems. 32-bit systems are based on data 4 octets wide, while 64-bit system hosts 8 octets. These systems cannot be interchanged; a 32-bit OS will not run on a 64-bit CPU. 32-bit systems limit the RAM amount to around 3.2 GB, while 64-bit systems can use up to 17 billion GB of RAM. A 64-bit system is more efficient and secure than the 32-bit counterpart.
