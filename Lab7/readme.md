### Purpose of File Compression
The purpose of a zip file is to easily group multiple files into one file. They also are compressed, so the zip file has a smaller total file size compared to the files on their own.
### Compression and File Size
When compressing image files, the SVG file will result in being a lot smaller than a JPG file would compress to. This is because SVG is easily scalable, while losing no quality whatsoever. This is because SVG uses mathematical structures to represent an image, rather than relying on lossy compression like JPG files do.
