## Software
An operating system is required to use a piece of hardware. An operating system manages the hardware resources, provides a user interface, and provides a platform for developers to create applications for. An example of an operating system Microsoft Windows. An application is a program that is used to accomplish a specific goal. An example of this is Microsoft Word, an application that was designed to create and view documents. Finally, utility software is software that will allow the user to modify the computer in some way. For example, an anti-virus program such as Avast or Webroot will remove malicious or unwanted programs. Programming software is used to write code and produce software such as Python. 
### ERP 
ERP software, or Enterprise Resource Planning software, is developed to bring together an organization with one program. It uses a central database to connect all parts of the organization. All users use the same software application and edit the same database, so that every member of the organization is on the same page. Some of the most well-known ERP systems come from SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft.
### Problems Solved By Virtualization
A common problem in IT was that a server was dedicated to one specific task, meaning most servers are not running to their full potential. Some servers may run only at 30% of their full capacity due to being assigned only one task. Virtualization can be used to run multiple tasks on a single piece of hardware. This can be used to make the hardware or server run at it's maximum capacity, while freeing up space for other free servers to run more tasks. Virtualization helps hardware run more effectively.
### Role of Hypervisor
A hypervisor is a kind of emulator that creates and runs virtual machines, or a simulated computer. The hypervisor helps virtualize in a system. It acts as the manager and divides and partitions the resources of the hardware.
## Python
### Pseudo-Code Nature of Python
The "pseudo-code nature of Python" refers to the fact that Python is very easy to learn; Python is made so programmers can worry more on the solutions to the code rather than how to write and format it. Pseudo-code makes it simple for programmers to jump in. 
### Interpreted vs. Compiled Language
A compiled language takes the entire program as its input, rather than an interpreter, which takes a single instruction as its input. A compiler generates intermediate object code, while an interpreter does not. A compiler generally executes faster. A compiler requires more memory due to its need to create object code. A compiler only needs to compile once, while an interpreter has to convert high-level languages to low-level programs at execution. Finally, a compiler displays errors once the whole program is checked, while an interpreter displays errors when each instruction is run.
