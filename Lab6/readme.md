### IP Address
An IP Address, or an Internet Protocol Address, is a set of number assigned to a singular device. This IP Address identifies where to send and recieve packets of info to and from the internet. The difference between IPv4 and IPv6 are the number of unique IP addresses it can generate. IPv4 has just over 4 billion unique IP Addresses, while IPv6 has 340 undecillion addresses. 
### ICANN
ICANN stands for the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. ICANN is a non-profit corperation that distributes and regulates IP Addresses and helps everythong flow smoothly. By coordinating how the internet runs, ICANN has cemented its place on the evolution of internet.
### TCP/IP
The TCP/IP, which stands for Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol, and is responsible for dfining the details of how data is sent and recieved through network adapters, switches, routers, etc. This is a prime example of the client-server model because the clients are all assigned a unique IP Address, in which 65535 ports can be used to communicate with. A TCP/IP port can be used as a private two-way communication through a server. 
### Layers
Layers are important to channging technology because it provides an easier way to change just one part of the whole model. With multiple layers, different models can work at once without disturbing the other layers.
### Application Layer
HTTP, FTP, POP3, SMTP, and SNMP are all types of applications that run on the "application layer". 
### HTTP and Client-Server Model
HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol., and is the protocol that is used for viewing webpages. HTTP is an example of the client-server model because the client connects to the server using the internet to send data, and the server then sends packets back to the client using the internet. 
### Protocols for Secure HTTP
Secure HTTP uses SSL and TLS to encrypt data. SSL works by the browser requesting an SSL certificate from the server to authenticate the identity of the server. TLS also authenticates the server, client, and encrypts the data, and is the successor to SSL.
### Securing your Web Browser
It is incredibly important to secure your web browser because we do everything on the web these days, such as shopping, banking, etc. With an insecure web browser, information entered on these websites can easily be compromised and stolen. One potential risk while browsing the internet is the use of cookies. Cookies are files that are placed on the system by a website that may be used to uniquely identify visitors of a website. Hackers may be able to obtain access to the system's unique cookie and steal the credentials of an unsuspecting victim. 
### World Wide Web Consortium
Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of the World Wide Web. He created the W3C to lead the Web to its full potential, making it accessible and easy for the average person to use. The Web of Devices standard is extremely important because it allows any device to access the Web using any device. This allows mobile Web access, voice search on websites, touchscreen access of websites, variable sizes of content based on device size and capabilities, and smart TVs to use the internet.
### HTML5 and CSS
The purpose of HTML5 is to easily make web pages using a standard markup language. The purpose of CSS is to format the layout of the page. I used HTML5 to write the actual webpage and the text that appears on it. Afterwards, I used CSS to add color, a border around the text, and a background for the website. 
### HTML and XML 
The difference between HTML and XML is what they were designed for. XML was designed to carry data, with a focus on what data is, while HTML was designed to display data, with a focus on how that data looks. Additionally, XML tags are not predefined, unlike HTML tags.
