## Python IDLE
The shell of Python IDLE runs code one at a time, and is a good way to test what instructions do. The file editor lets the user add code for complete programs.
### Python Terms
A variable is a value that can vary or be rewritten to store a different value. A variable is like a box one can store a single value in. An example of a variable is the code "spam = 42", where "spam" is the variable. The book uses variable names "spam", "eggs", and "bacon" as a nod to the Monty Python "Spam" sketch. An assignment statement assigns a value to the variable for later use. This would be the equivalent to one placing an item inside a box. In the same example of "spam = 42", the whole statement is called the assignment statement, since it assigns the variable to a value. A function defines what kind of operation Python will perform. For example, the print() function displays the string value inside the parentheses. Integers are values that are whole numbers, such as the number 25. Numbers with a decimal point are called floating-point numbers, such as 36.0. A string is a text value such as 'Hello'.
