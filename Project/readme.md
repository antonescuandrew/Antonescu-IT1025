## Executive Summary
I indend to become co-op ready for my project, and I have already submitted my application form. 
## Co-op
To become co-op ready, first I must participate in the co-op orientation process through the Tri-C career center, which includes applying and working with the career center. After this, I will upload my resume for revisions and get approval from a career coach at Handshake. Next, I will work with an Employer Relations Specialist to apply and interview into co-op positions. Finally, I will complete and sign a Cooperative Education Agreement form and register for the college credit. The co-op process is very simple and I plan to follow it.
## Conclusion
While I have been completing this course, I noticed that mobile programming really got my interest! I aspire to one day make an app and take it with me on the go! Though it sounds far away, I would like to make a free ad-less music app for myself to enjoy! Also, with the introduction to Python, I would like to get fluent in it! Programming as a whole facinates me, so any chance I get to learn about it, I'll take it! I am planning on working towards a Mobile Development certificate.
