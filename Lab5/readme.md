## Lucidchart
My experience with Lucidchart was mostly positive. I started by hovering my cursor over all of the different shapes available to me, and was surprised to see different shapes have different meanings. I really enjoyed being able to simply click and drag the shapes to place them onto the concept map. The arrows were incredibly simple to add, but I couldn't figure out how to remove them once there. I had to start from scratch again, but I was much more familiar with the tools the second time around. Overall, I would love to use Lucidchart again! I feel as though it could be extremely helpful to learning.
## Data Transmission
A packet is the foundational unit of data on the Internet. These packets sometimes partake in packet-switching, which is the process of packets being sent to different routes and then assembled when it reaches its destination. An IP Address is a unique identifying address for each device, so that the packets know which device to go to. A DNS is a directory of IP address common names, and every website has an IP address. A protocol is a set of rules placed to allow devices to communicate on the network. 
## Network Hardware
A switch can learn MAC Addresses and directs the packet only to the intended port, unlike a hub, which sends the packet to all the connected ports. A router is better than a switch because it can route data from one network to another by reading IP Addresses, meaning it can connect to the Internet.
## Network Topology
A single point of failure is when a central point on a network fails and shuts down the entire network. The star and ring topologies experience this issue. The Wireless Mesh and Infrastructure Topologies are very similar. In the Infrastructure topology, it uses a mix of wired and wireless devices. Devices can connect directly to the switch. The switch is connected to a Wireless Access Point to broadcast a signal for wireless devices to connect. Wireless Mesh is very similar, though once a Wireless Access Point is connected to the switch, it can communicate wirelessly with other Wireless Access Points in the area, extending the signal. A Wireless Mesh Topology is better because it is very redundant, meaning if one of the Wireless Access Points go down, the rest are not affected. It provides a more reliable connection, while having the ability for the connection to reach further.
## Network Design
My design is based off of the Infrastructure Topology. Starting off, a modem is connected to a router using a wire. This router is used to connect the computers to the Internet using a wire as well. The router is then connected to a Wireless Access Point using a wire. The Wireless Access Point allows the printer to connect wirelessly to the network.
