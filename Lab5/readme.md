## Lucidchart
My experience with Lucidchart was mostly positive. I started by hovering my cursor over all of the different shapes available to me, and was surprised to see different shapes have different meanings. I really enjoyed being able to simply click and drag the shapes to place them onto the concept map. The arrows were incredibly simple to add, but I couldn't figure out how to remove them once there. I had to start from scratch again, but I was much more familiar with the tools the second time around. Overall, I would love to use Lucidchart again! I feel as though it could be extremely helpful to learning.
## Data Transmission
A packet is the foundational unit of data on the Internet. These packets sometimes partake in packet-switching, which is the process of packets being sent to different routes and then assembled when it reaches its destination. An IP Address is a unique identifying address for each device, so that the packets know which device to go to. A DNS is a directory of IP address common names, and every website has an IP address. A protocol is a set of rules placed to allow devices to communicate on the network. 
## Network Hardware
A switch can learn MAC Addresses and directs the packet only to the intended port, unlike a hub, which sends the packet to all the connected ports. A router is better than a switch because it can route data from one network to another by reading IP Addresses, meaning it can connect to the Internet.
