### Data, Information, and Knowledge
Data is a series of facts. The two different types of data are qualitative or quantative. Qualitative data is numeric and comes from a form of measurement or calculation. Qualitative data is descriptive, such as "black" when describing the color of a laptop. Information, however, is processed data that provides context, relevance, and purpose. For example, the total revenue in a year calculated by the revenue of each day is an example of data. Knowledge is the relationships between this data that inspires action. An example of knowledge is the relationship between a sales pitch and how many sales it gained. 
### Relational Data
If I was creating a database for a small company using a customers and orders table, the primary keys would be a customer number (if possible) or a customer name, and an order number. These would be related by assigning an order number to a customer ID. The foreign key in the orders table would also be the customer number, as it links the two tables together.
### Field Data Types
It is important to properly define the data type of a field because each data type has a different set of restrictions or inputs. For example, a date/time field is interpreted as either a number or a time. If one were to accidentally identify the data type as a boolean, it would only let the user select two values, such as 0 and 1. Selecting the wrong data type may make the data representation either difficult to display, if not impossible.
### Big Data
The four "Vs" of big data are Volume, Variety, Velocity, and Variability. Volume refers to the size of the data. Variety refers to the sources of the data, such as PDFs, audio, video, etc. Velocity refers to the speed of generation of the data. Finally, variability refers to the inconsistancies in the data at times. Some technologies that have driven the increase of big data are social medias, customer feedback surveys, and staging areas for new data.
